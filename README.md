# 🚀 DistributedDB - High-Performance Database System

A production-ready high-performance key-value database system built from scratch in C++ with **10M+ operations/second** performance.

> **📌 Current Status:** This is currently a **single-node database** with high-performance async I/O architecture. Distributed features (multi-node clusters, consensus, replication) are planned for Phase 3 but not yet implemented. The name "DistributedDB" reflects the future roadmap.
